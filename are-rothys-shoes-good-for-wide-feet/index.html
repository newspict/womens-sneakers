<center>Rothy&#039;s Shoes Review Wardrobe Oxygen From wardrobeoxygen.com</center>
<p>The rothy sneaker, loafer, and booties come in small sizing &amp; fit therefore they are usually tight in size. A rothy’s shoe has a flat sole, which means it does not provide the same type of arch support as other shoes. I have a wider foot and prefer the loafers. If you step awkward or your foot rolls to the side the shoe will give and rotate on your foot so they are not supportive at all.</p>

<p>Honestly, they are slightly uncomfortable for wide feet, and sometimes my pinky toe will go numb from being squeezed in there, but i still wear them almost every day. For rothy’s, i first ordered a 10 in the flats thinking that counted as sizing up. If you have wide feet, you may be like me. I have average to narrow feet, so if you have wide feet i could see this being an issue for the point style. If you are shopping for shoes on a budget but want to make sure you are buying quality ones, rothys shoes may be what you are looking for. It seems like rothy�s knits their shoes on the narrow side, and probably relies on the flexibility of the material and stretch over time to mould to wider feet.</p>

<p>Rothy�s Shoes Review Wardrobe Oxygen, Yup, they are an investment for sure but because of the classic look (won’t be going out of style anytime soon), durability and with the ability to wash, i believe they are totally worth it.

<p>Rothy�s Shoes Review Wardrobe Oxygen, I would definitely say to go up a full size if you do not have super narrow feet.

<p>Rothy�s Shoes Review Wardrobe Oxygen, Rothy�s says that their shoes do not stretch over time, so if they are snug, exchange them for a half size larger. I know what my true size is for the length of my foot, but i generally always size up a half to full size because of my width. For maximum comfort, consider going up a half a size.</p>

<p>Tuesday Shoesday A Rothy�s Review my 9 to 5 shoes, They’ll stretch out a little bit and form to your feet after a few weeks of wear. I normally wear a 6.5 shoe size but due to reviews, decided to go up a size on both shoes. For maximum comfort, consider going up a half a size for narrow feet, and a full size for wider feet. I’ll be honest,.</p>

<p>Rothy�s Shoes Review Wardrobe Oxygen, A rothy’s shoe has a flat sole, which means it does not provide the same type of arch support as other shoes.

<p>Rothy�s Sizing The Flat &amp; The Point since wen, Do rothys have arch support? If you step awkward or your foot rolls to the side the shoe will give and rotate on your foot so they are not supportive at all. My rothy�s are the best travel companions because they�re lightweight and easy to slip on and off. Rothys is quite flexible in that it allows for free returns.</p>
