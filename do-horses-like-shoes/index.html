<p>WHY DO PEOPLE SHOE THEIR HORSES? OneHorseLife, Depending on what type of surface/work your horse will be doing, they don�t always need to wear shoes. In fact, most horses only need shoes for the front part. Horse shoes do not provide traction, unless it is a very specialized shoe.

<p>Why Do Horses Need Shoes &amp; Common Types of Horseshoes, I�ve never seen a horse react to getting their hooves done (shoes or not) as though it were a treat, but most horses handle it just fine without complaint. A horses’ natural hoof is also constantly contracting (much like our lungs!), so ensuring that their shoes are properly fitted and checking that they are wearing the correct size will avoid.</p>

Like almost all mammals, horses are viviparous animals, meaning that fecundation and development of the embryo.</p>
